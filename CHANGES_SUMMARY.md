# Changes Summary - Team Setup Improvements

## What Changed

This commit includes changes to ensure your team can clone and run the application immediately without any setup issues.

### 1. Updated `.gitignore`

**Removed:**
- Umbraco-specific ignores for `App_Data` subdirectories (Logs, TEMP, cache, preview, NuGetBackup)
- `package-lock.json` from ignore list

**Why:**
- The Umbraco database (`Umbraco.sqlite.db`) and all content are now tracked in Git
- `package-lock.json` is now committed to ensure everyone gets the exact same npm package versions
- This means team members can clone and run immediately without database setup

### 2. Added `package-lock.json`

This file is now tracked in version control to ensure reproducible builds across all team members' machines.

### 3. Updated `package.json`

Added shorthand npm scripts:
- `npm run build` - Build Tailwind CSS
- `npm run watch` - Watch Tailwind CSS for changes

(Previous `build:css` and `watch:css` scripts still work)

### 4. Created Documentation

**New Files:**
- `SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide for new team members
- Updated `README.md` - Better project overview and quick start guide

## Files to Commit

```bash
# Modified files
.gitignore
Onatrix_CMS/package.json
README.md

# New files
SETUP.md
Onatrix_CMS/package-lock.json
```

## What Your Team Needs to Do

After cloning the repository, they only need to run:

```bash
cd Onatrix_CMS/Onatrix_CMS
dotnet restore
npm install
dotnet run
```

That's it! The database, content, media files, and all configuration are included.

## Benefits

✅ **Zero database setup** - SQLite database is included
✅ **All content included** - via uSync configuration
✅ **Reproducible builds** - package-lock.json ensures same dependencies
✅ **Complete media library** - all images and assets included
✅ **Clear documentation** - SETUP.md guides new developers
✅ **One-command start** - just `dotnet run`

## Notes

- The SQLite database file is ~2MB, perfectly fine for version control
- Build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/`) are still ignored (as they should be)
- Team members will need .NET 9.0 SDK and Node.js installed
